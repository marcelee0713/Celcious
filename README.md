Hello!
In this website I'm practicing Sass or SCSS, and it is really convenient and efficient. I also discovered Font Awesome and it is really great as well. After this, I'm going to learn JavaScript now since I think already know enough about CSS. I think I might be inactive again in GitHub because I usually practice offline most of the times when I'm learning something new. That's pretty much it! See you soon!
