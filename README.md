# Celcious

Hello!
In this website I'm practicing Sass or SCSS, and it is really convenient and efficient. I also discovered Font Awesome and it is really great as well. After this, I'm going to learn JavaScript now since I think already know enough about CSS. I think I might be inactive again in GitHub because I usually practice offline most of the times when I'm learning something new. That's pretty much it! See you soon!

Hello, I've been gone for almost a month and my OOP Subject wants us to create an real-life application. Then, first thing comes in my mind that, "Hey I guess the Celcious website that I made long ago is a great opportunity to start an actual business or a project out of it". So why not? Anyways, I'm going to be active in GitHub again and I'm going to learn Firebase. Thank you for tuning in!

Hello, since I am learning NextJS, Tailwind, Prisma, and also NextAuth. I will be also using <b>Cloudinary</b> for storing my user's pictures review and the Products.

The reason why I am updating this and doing it again. Is that I want to <b>apply</b> on what I just learned.

I might also switch up <b>Supabase</b> after this project. This will be <b>shown</b> in my portfolio soon.

It's been really tough and I'm glad that I made this through and have a progress in my life.

From:
<b>HTML, CSS, and SCSS</b>

To: <b>Android Studio, Flutter, Firebase, JavaScript, TypeScript, NextJS, NextAuth, Tailwind, and Prisma</b>

Progress maybe slow but I am trying to do my best, I learned a lot especially this SQL or Prisma, especially about <b>connecting Relationships</b>, <b>Next Auth Callback Sessions</b>, <b>Email Verification by using Nodemailer and JWT Token</b>, and also the difference between the server and client components.

I also struggle sometimes with keeping up. But I don't want to be comfortable, and I will never stop learning.

Thank you, for this challenging journey.

I have done a lot of stuff in this, especially with the add to cart functionality and <b>normalization of the database tables</b> and <b>middleware</b>.

But I might not be that active on this repository, and now for this <b>life update</b>.

I have to learn Unity. Even though I hate it, I have no other choice but to do a project for 10 months just for the <b>Capstone Project I & II</b>.

I'll try as much as I can to at least make a commit on this project. Because I really need to show this off on my <b>Portfolio</b>.
