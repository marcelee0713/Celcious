# Celcious

Hello!
In this website I'm practicing Sass or SCSS, and it is really convenient and efficient. I also discovered Font Awesome and it is really great as well. After this, I'm going to learn JavaScript now since I think already know enough about CSS. I think I might be inactive again in GitHub because I usually practice offline most of the times when I'm learning something new. That's pretty much it! See you soon!

Hello, I've been gone for almost a month and my OOP Subject wants us to create an real-life application. Then, first thing comes in my mind that, "Hey I guess the Celcious website that I made long ago is a great opportunity to start an actual business or a project out of it". So why not? Anyways, I'm going to be active in GitHub again and I'm going to learn Firebase. Thank you for tuning in!

## UPDATE

June 7, 2023

Hello, since I am learning NextJS, Tailwind, Prisma, and also NextAuth. I will be also using Firebase Storage for storing my user's pictures review and the Products.

The reason why I am updating this and doing it again. <b>Apply</b> on what I just learned.

I might also switch up <b>Supabase</b> after this project. This will be <b>shown</b> in my portfolio soon.

It's been really tough and I'm glad that I made this through and have a progress in my life.

From:
<b>HTML, CSS, and SCSS</b>

To: <b>TypeScript, NextJS, Flutter, Firebase, and Prisma</b>
