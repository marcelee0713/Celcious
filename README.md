# Celcious
Hello!
In this website I'm practicing Sass or SCSS, and it is really convenient and efficient. I also discovered Font Awesome and it is really great as well. After this, I'm going to learn JavaScript now since I think already know enough about CSS. I think I might be inactive again in GitHub because I usually practice offline most of the times when I'm learning something new. That's pretty much it! See you soon!
## UPDATE

Hello, I've been gone for almost a month and my OOP Subject wants us to create an real-life application. Then, first thing comes in my mind that, "Hey I guess the Celcious website that I made long ago is a great opportunity to start an actual business or a project out of it". So why not? Anyways, I'm going to be active in GitHub again and I'm going to learn Firebase. Thank you for tuning in!
